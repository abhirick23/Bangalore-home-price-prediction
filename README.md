# Bangalore-home-price-prediction


My goal for this project is to build an end to end solution or application that is capable of predicting the house prices better than individuals. Another motivation for this project is to implement similar solution at my workplace and help Investments and Residential team make data driven decisions.

Machine learning, more specifically the field of predictive modeling is primarily concerned with minimizing the error of a model or making the most accurate predictions possible, at the expense of explainability. In applied machine learning we will borrow, reuse and steal algorithms from many different fields, including statistics and use them towards these ends.
As such, linear regression was developed in the field of statistics and is studied as a model for understanding the relationship between input and output numerical variables, but has been borrowed by machine learning. It is both a statistical algorithm and a machine learning algorithm.


Other Detail:

This project has been developed by Abhiroop Sarkar for the purpose of institutional project. Further Model Deployement is on process.

Dataset can be shared on requirement basis for educational purpose only. Candidate with requirement can mail a by mentioning the designation and current role with proper identity card in attachment.

Thank You, Have a Nice Day!
